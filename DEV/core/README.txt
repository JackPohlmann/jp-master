# Rebuilding the core directory

Need to redo SAIG (not completely) to work a little more fluidly.
*  Don't need any sort of abstract base class.
*  Should be very simple: give it data, angle ranges, and look-direction.
*  Interp/extrapolation support? This might need to be handled by the individual plugins, but it might be cleaner/safer to just have the plugins choose one.
