# 
# * Main module 'workflow' should be contained here.
# 
# * This should be the location of all core.<mod> imports, NOT the main script.
# 
# * The recipe object should be defined here?
#   OKAY: probably won't cause any problems with recursive imports.
#   NOTE: This requires that each core.<mod> should be completely standalone.
